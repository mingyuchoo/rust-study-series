# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a Rust-based plugin system that enables dynamic runtime feature extension through a workspace architecture. The system allows the core application to load and execute plugins without recompilation, providing a flexible and extensible architecture.

## Glossary

- **Core Application**: The main executable that hosts and manages plugins
- **Plugin**: A dynamically loadable library that extends the Core Application's functionality
- **Plugin Manager**: The component within the Core Application responsible for discovering, loading, and managing Plugin lifecycle
- **Plugin Interface**: The trait-based contract that all Plugins must implement
- **Plugin Registry**: The data structure that stores loaded Plugin instances
- **Workspace**: A Cargo workspace containing multiple related crates (Core Application, Plugin Interface, and Plugin implementations)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define a common plugin interface, so that all plugins follow a consistent contract

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Plugin Interface SHALL define a trait with initialization, execution, and cleanup methods
2. THE Plugin Interface SHALL expose version information for compatibility checking
3. THE Plugin Interface SHALL provide metadata access including plugin name and description
4. THE Plugin Interface SHALL be published as a separate crate within the Workspace

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the core application to dynamically load plugins at runtime, so that I can extend functionality without recompilation

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Core Application starts, THE Plugin Manager SHALL discover available Plugin libraries in a designated directory
2. THE Plugin Manager SHALL load each discovered Plugin using dynamic library loading
3. IF a Plugin fails to load, THEN THE Plugin Manager SHALL log the error and continue loading other Plugins
4. THE Core Application SHALL maintain a Plugin Registry of successfully loaded Plugins
5. THE Core Application SHALL invoke Plugin initialization methods after loading

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want to implement the plugin interface, so that my plugin can be loaded by the core application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Plugin SHALL implement all methods defined in the Plugin Interface trait
2. THE Plugin SHALL export a constructor function using the C ABI for dynamic loading
3. THE Plugin SHALL be compiled as a dynamic library (cdylib)
4. THE Plugin SHALL declare dependency on the Plugin Interface crate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the core application to execute loaded plugins, so that plugin functionality is available at runtime

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Core Application needs to execute plugin functionality, THE Plugin Manager SHALL iterate through the Plugin Registry
2. THE Plugin Manager SHALL invoke the execute method on each registered Plugin
3. IF a Plugin execution fails, THEN THE Plugin Manager SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
4. THE Core Application SHALL support passing context data to Plugin execution methods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper plugin lifecycle management, so that resources are properly allocated and released

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Core Application shuts down, THE Plugin Manager SHALL invoke cleanup methods on all loaded Plugins
2. THE Plugin Manager SHALL unload Plugin libraries in reverse order of loading
3. THE Plugin Manager SHALL ensure all Plugin resources are released before application exit

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example plugins demonstrating the system, so that I can understand how to create new plugins

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Workspace SHALL include at least two example Plugin implementations
2. EACH example Plugin SHALL demonstrate different functionality
3. THE example Plugins SHALL include inline documentation explaining implementation details
