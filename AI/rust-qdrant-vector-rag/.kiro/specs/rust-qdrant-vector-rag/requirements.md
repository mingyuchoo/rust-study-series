# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) web service using Rust, Qdrant vector database, and Azure OpenAI API. The system will parse markdown files to build a knowledge base, store document embeddings in Qdrant, and provide intelligent question-answering capabilities through a web interface built with Actix Web.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to upload markdown files to build a searchable knowledge base, so that I can later query this information intelligently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads markdown files THEN the system SHALL parse the content and extract text chunks
2. WHEN markdown content is parsed THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI text-embedding-3-large model
3. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in Qdrant vector database with associated metadata
4. IF a markdown file contains headers, code blocks, or lists THEN the system SHALL preserve the structure during chunking
5. WHEN file processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return a success confirmation to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about my uploaded documents, so that I can get accurate answers based on the stored knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL generate an embedding for the query using Azure OpenAI
2. WHEN query embedding is generated THEN the system SHALL search Qdrant for the most relevant document chunks
3. WHEN relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL use them as context for Azure OpenAI GPT-4 to generate an answer
4. WHEN an answer is generated THEN the system SHALL return the response along with source references
5. IF no relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no matching information was found

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service to be configurable through environment variables, so that I can deploy it in different environments securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read Azure OpenAI configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read Qdrant connection details from environment variables
3. IF required environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages
4. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate API connectivity before accepting requests
5. WHEN sensitive configuration is used THEN the system SHALL NOT log API keys or sensitive data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web service to provide RESTful API endpoints, so that I can integrate it with other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL expose HTTP endpoints using Actix Web framework
2. WHEN a POST request is made to /upload THEN the system SHALL accept markdown files and process them
3. WHEN a POST request is made to /query THEN the system SHALL accept questions and return answers
4. WHEN a GET request is made to /health THEN the system SHALL return service status
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that I receive meaningful feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Azure OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return a service unavailable error
2. WHEN Qdrant database is unreachable THEN the system SHALL return a database connection error
3. WHEN invalid file formats are uploaded THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a rate limit error with retry information
5. WHEN internal errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information while returning user-friendly messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to efficiently chunk large markdown documents, so that the retrieval process is accurate and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large markdown files THEN the system SHALL split content into optimal chunks for embedding
2. WHEN chunking content THEN the system SHALL maintain semantic coherence within each chunk
3. WHEN chunks are created THEN the system SHALL include overlapping content to preserve context
4. WHEN storing chunks THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as source file, chunk position, and headers
5. WHEN chunk size exceeds embedding model limits THEN the system SHALL further subdivide the content
