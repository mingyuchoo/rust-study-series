# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a modern, responsive Svelte frontend application that provides a user-friendly interface for an AI-powered document search and question-answering system. The frontend will connect to the existing Rust backend that uses Qdrant vector database and Azure OpenAI to process PDF documents, store them as vectors, and provide intelligent search capabilities. The application will be built using pnpm as the build tool and SvelteUI as the CSS framework to ensure a polished, professional user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload PDF documents to the system, so that I can later search and ask questions about their content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the upload page THEN the system SHALL display a drag-and-drop file upload interface
2. WHEN a user drags a PDF file over the upload area THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the file can be dropped
3. WHEN a user drops a PDF file or selects it via file browser THEN the system SHALL validate that the file is a PDF format
4. WHEN a valid PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL send the file to the backend `/upload` endpoint using multipart form data
5. WHEN the upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator with upload status
6. WHEN the upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message with document ID and processing details
7. WHEN the upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message with retry option
8. IF the file is not a PDF THEN the system SHALL display a validation error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about uploaded documents, so that I can quickly find relevant information without manually reading through entire documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the search page THEN the system SHALL display a prominent search input field
2. WHEN a user types a question THEN the system SHALL provide real-time character count and input validation
3. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL send the query to the backend `/query` endpoint
4. WHEN the query is processing THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with "AI is thinking..." message
5. WHEN the AI response is received THEN the system SHALL display the answer in a readable format
6. WHEN sources are available THEN the system SHALL display source references with document names, relevance scores, and text snippets
7. WHEN no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL display a "No relevant information found" message
8. WHEN the query fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with option to retry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure search parameters, so that I can customize the search behavior to get more relevant results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses advanced search options THEN the system SHALL display configuration controls for search parameters
2. WHEN a user adjusts max chunks parameter THEN the system SHALL validate the value is between 1 and 20
3. WHEN a user adjusts similarity threshold THEN the system SHALL validate the value is between 0.0 and 1.0
4. WHEN a user adjusts temperature setting THEN the system SHALL validate the value is between 0.0 and 1.0
5. WHEN a user submits a query with custom config THEN the system SHALL include the configuration in the API request
6. WHEN invalid configuration values are entered THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
7. WHEN a user resets configuration THEN the system SHALL restore default values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the system health and status, so that I can understand if the service is working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display overall system health status
2. WHEN the system is healthy THEN the system SHALL show green status indicators for all services
3. WHEN any service is unhealthy THEN the system SHALL show red status indicators with error details
4. WHEN health check is in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
5. WHEN health data is available THEN the system SHALL display Azure OpenAI and Qdrant connection status
6. WHEN uptime information is available THEN the system SHALL display system uptime
7. IF health check fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and accessible interface, so that I can use the application on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN a user accesses the application on tablets THEN the system SHALL display a tablet-optimized layout
3. WHEN a user accesses the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a desktop-optimized layout
4. WHEN a user navigates using keyboard only THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management and keyboard shortcuts
5. WHEN a user uses screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML
6. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively
7. WHEN touch interactions are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and gestures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear navigation and user feedback, so that I can easily understand how to use the application and what actions are taking place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a clear navigation menu with Upload, Search, and Dashboard sections
2. WHEN a user performs any action THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN long-running operations occur THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators with estimated completion time
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
5. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL display success notifications
6. WHEN the user is on a specific page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current navigation item
7. WHEN the application is loading THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate loading state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle network errors gracefully, so that I can continue using the service even when connectivity issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL display an offline indicator
2. WHEN API requests fail due to network issues THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
3. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN requests timeout THEN the system SHALL display timeout error messages with retry options
5. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically retry failed requests
6. WHEN multiple requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff for retries
7. IF the backend returns error responses THEN the system SHALL parse and display meaningful error messages
